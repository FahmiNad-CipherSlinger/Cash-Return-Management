# Cash-Return-Management
We will accept the input bill amount and handle the error instances to develop our Cash Management webpage, which will throw an error if someone enters a negative bill amount or more than the specified amount. Next, we'll use our primary logic to display the result (table) of the fewest notes we can possibly return to the user. The bare minimum of notes that the customer will get as a return in balance will be counted on this webpage. Given a bill amount of $500 and a BDT of $1,000, the system determines the minimal number of notes that must be returned to the user.
